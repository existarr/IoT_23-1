 * This is a program that recovers broker when some problem occurs to it.
 * When a broker is terminated unintentionally, this program detects it and creates and executes a new broker. 
 * For this purpose, the broker's status is checked every second.
 * If there is a problem, the program attempts to recover until the broker operates normally.
 * 
 * Also, all the logs of the broker's status are published to the 'admin/logs/broker' topic.
